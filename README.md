# üõ°Ô∏èüèπ AI Agents Battle ‚öîÔ∏èüó°Ô∏è

## Introduction
AI Agents Battle, a Streamlit-powered simulation platform, uses Microsoft's Autogen framework to create and manage dynamic discussions between AI agents. Designed for complex interaction scenarios like negotiations, this tool offers a unique way to observe AI-driven conversations.

## Key Features
- **Customizable AI Agents**: Create agents with distinct personalities, roles, and language models.
- **Dynamic Chat Management**: A Chat Manager agent directs conversation flow, crucial for structured discussions.
- **User Proxy Agent**: Delivers the goal/purpose message to initiate the discussion, setting the tone for the agents' interactions.
- **Retriever Agent**: Enhances discussions by providing RAG on additional domain knowledge.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Define the discussion's purpose, configure agents, and add domain knowledge.
- **Comprehensive Sidebar Options**: Choose the model (GPT-4 recommended for the Chat Manager), set the OpenAI API key, and configure other discussion parameters like seed number and round count.
